<p>Glovelet is wearable tracking glove that can replace the traditional mouse to a more user-interactive and easy to use device. This would greatly enhance the user experience and would allow users to use their hands to move objects, both two-dimensional and three dimensional, on the computer screen thereby making the experience more intuitive for younger and older adults.</p>

<p>Glovlet provides natural feeling gestures performed by your hand(s). The movement or rotation of the tracker or 3D object in the virtual environment is a one-to-one movement with the glove. Minimal computation is used onboard the actual glove unit.</p>
