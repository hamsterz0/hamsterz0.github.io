I am a graduate student completing my MS in Computer Science at University of California Los Angeles (UCLA).

This Summer 2019 I'll be interning with the Analysis and Experimentation team (under Azureâ€™s AI Platform organization) at <a href="https://microsoft.com/" target="_blank"> Microsoft </a>. I have previously interned at <a href="https://cloud9perception.com/" target="_blank">Cloud 9 Perception</a>, <a href="https://nod.com/" target="_blank">Nod Labs</a> and <a href="https://idir.uta.edu/index.php/Innovative_Database_and_Information_Systems_Research_Laboratory" target="_blank">IDIR Labs</a> as a Software Engineering Intern. 

I have also worked as an Undergradate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://heracleia.uta.edu/" target="_blank">Heracleia Lab</a>, where I worked primarily on Rewind/Remind and published my <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3076178" target="_blank">first research paper</a> in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE196" target="_blank">PETRA Conference</a> in Greece in 2017.

I enjoy good music, food and comedy.
