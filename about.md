"Mess with the best, die like the rest" - Crash Override (Hackers-1995)

This Summer 2019 I'll be working with the Analysis and Experimentation team at <a href="https://microsoft.com/" target="_blank">Microsoft</a>. I previously worked at <a href="https://nod.com/" target="_blank">Nod Labs</a>.

I have also worked as an Undergradate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://heracleia.uta.edu/" target="_blank">Heracleia Lab</a>, where I worked primarily on Rewind/Remind and published my <a href="https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3076178" target="_blank">research paper</a> in the <a href="https://dl.acm.org/event.cfm?id=RE196" target="_blank">PETRA Conference</a> in Greece in 2017.

I enjoy good hacks, music, food and comedy.
